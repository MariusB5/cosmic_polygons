A simple 3D space shooter videogame in **Godot Engine 4**.

Videogame based on the tutorial provided by *Master Albert* on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_zN-7Xggw4), but **highly modified** and **improved** by me.

Retro laser sound and retro explosion sound provided for free by *MATRIXXX_* at [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/MATRIXXX_/).

Music purchased by me at [Ovani Sound](https://ovanisound.com/).
